# Legacy App Modernization: From Struts 1.3 to Spring Boot
## Overview

This project is a practical demonstration of modernizing a legacy application, based on the Struts 1.3 demo application. The main goal is to migrate the original source code to a contemporary technology stack, illustrating an effective approach to updating older Java systems.

The transformation leverages modern technologies and AI-assisted development tools to optimize the process and ensure a robust and up-to-date result.
## Technology Stack

The new version of the application was developed using the following technologies:

- Backend: Spring Boot - For simplified, robust, and self-contained backend development.

- Frontend (View Layer): Thymeleaf - A modern template engine, natively integrated into the Spring ecosystem.

- Styling and UI: Bootstrap - For creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface with minimal effort.

## AI-Assisted Development

To accelerate and enhance the migration and development process, the following AI tools were used:

- Claude.ai: Used for code refactoring, translating business logic from Struts to Spring, and solving complex migration challenges.

- GitHub Copilot: Employed for real-time code autocompletion, generating boilerplate, and accelerating the implementation of new features.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to serve as a case study and a practical guide for developers and teams facing the challenge of modernizing legacy applications. It demonstrates how current technologies and AI tools can make this process faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.
