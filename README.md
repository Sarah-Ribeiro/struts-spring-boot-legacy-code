# Legacy Struts 1.3 Modernization Project

## Introduction
This project is a modernization of the [Struts 1.3 demo application](https://github.com/ShradhaPandey/Struts-1.3-demo-project), originally based on outdated Java and frameworks.  
The codebase has been re-engineered to leverage **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, **Bootstrap**, and **AI-assisted development tools** such as **Claude.ai** and **GitHub Copilot**, making it more maintainable, scalable, and future-proof.

## Architecture Comparison

| **Legacy (Before)**                      | **Modernized (After)**                    |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Java 5/6                                   | Java 21                                    |
| Apache Struts 1.3 MVC framework            | Spring Boot (REST + MVC)                   |
| JSP pages                                  | Thymeleaf templates                        |
| CSS manually handled or inline styles      | Bootstrap for responsive design            |
| XML-heavy configuration                    | Java-based configuration (Spring Boot)     |
| No AI development tools                    | AI-assisted coding (Claude.ai, GitHub Copilot) |

**Before:**  
The original application relied on the Struts 1.3 MVC framework, with JSP pages, verbose XML configuration, and older Java versions.  

**After:**  
The modernized version uses Spring Boot for backend services, Thymeleaf for templating, Bootstrap for styling, and AI tools to assist in writing clean, maintainable code.
